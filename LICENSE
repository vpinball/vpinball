IMPORTANT NOTE:
---------------

As of October 2020, we, the Visual Pinball team, are working on replacing
the inherited 'old MAME'-like license (listed directly below) by
the GPLv3+ License (see end of this file).

Each source file/snippet that is already under GPLv3+ will have its
very first line marked with
// license:GPLv3+
Every file/snippet that doesn't, will stay (for now) under the 'old MAME'-like license.
