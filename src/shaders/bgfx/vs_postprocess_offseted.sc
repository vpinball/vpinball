// w_h_height.xy contains inverse size of source texture (1/w, 1/h), i.e. one texel shift to the upper (DX)/lower (OpenGL) left texel. Since OpenGL has upside down textures it leads to a different texel if not sampled on both sides
// . for bloom, w_h_height.z keeps strength
// . for mirror, w_h_height.z keeps inverse strength
// . for AO, w_h_height.zw keeps per-frame offset for temporal variation of the pattern
// . for AA techniques, w_h_height.z keeps source texture width, w_h_height.w is a boolean set to 1 when depth is available
// . for parallax stereo, w_h_height.z keeps source texture height, w_h_height.w keeps the 3D offset
