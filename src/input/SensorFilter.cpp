// Accelerometer data filter.
//
// This is designed to process the raw acceleration data from a
// physical accelerometer installed in a cabinet to yield more
// realistic effects on the virtual ball.  With a physical
// accelerometer, there are inherent inaccuracies due to small
// measurement errors from the instrument and the finite sampling
// rate.  In addition, the VP simulation only approximates real
// time, so VP can only approximate the duration of each
// instantaneous acceleration - this can exaggerate some inputs
// and under-apply others.  Some of these sources of error are
// random and tend to cancel out over time, but others compound
// over many samples.  In practice there can be noticeable bias
// that causes unrealistic results in the simulation.
//
// This filter is designed to compensate for these various sources
// of error by applying some assumptions about how a real cabinet
// should behave, and adjusting the real input accelerations to
// more closely match how our ideal model cabinet would behave.
//
// The main constraint we use in this filter is net zero motion.
// When you nudge a real cabinet, you make it sway on its legs a
// little, but you don't usually move the cabinet across the
// floor - real cabinets are quite heavy so they tend to stay
// firmly rooted in place during normal play.  So once the swaying
// from a nudge dies out, which happens fairly quickly (in about
// one second, say), the cabinet is back where it started.  This
// means that the cabinet experienced a series of accelerations,
// back and forth, that ultimately canceled out and left the
// box at rest at its original position.  This is the central
// assumption of this filter: we should be able to add up
// (integrate) the series of instantaneous velocities imparted
// by the instantaneous accelerations over the course of a nudge,
// and we know that at the end, the sum should be zero, because
// the cabinet is back at rest at its starting location.  In
// practice, real accelerometer data for a real nudge event will
// come *close* to netting to zero, but won't quite get there;
// the discrepancy is from the various sources of error described
// above.  This filter tries to reconcile the imperfect measured
// data with our mathematically ideal model by making small
// adjustments to the measured data to get it to match the
// ideal model results.
//
// The point of the filter is to make the results *feel* more
// realistic by reducing visible artifacts from the measurement
// inaccuracies.  We thus have to take care that the filter's
// meedling hand doesn't itself become apparent as another
// visible artifact.  We try to keep the filter's effects subtle
// by trying to limit its intervention to small adjustments.
// For the most part, it kicks in at the point in a nudge where
// the real accelerometer data says things are coming back to rest
// naturally, and simply cleans up the tail end of the nudge
// response to get it to mathematical exactness.  The filter also
// notices a special situation where it shouldn't intervene,
// which is when there's a sustained acceleration in one
// direction.  Assuming that we're not operating under
// extraordinary conditions (e.g., on board an airplane
// accelerating down the runway), a sustained acceleration can
// only mean that someone picked up one end of the cabinet and
// is holding it at an angle.  In this case the ball *should*
// be accelerated in the direction of the tilt, so we don't
// attempt to zero out the net accelerations when we notice this
// type of condition.
//
// It's important to understand that this filter is only useful
// when the nudge inputs are coming from a physical, analog
// accelerometer installed in a standard, free-standing pinball
// cabinet.  The model and the parameters are tailored for this
// particular physical configuration, and it won't give good results
// for other setups.  In particular, don't use this filter with
// "digital" on/off nudge inputs, such as keyboard-based nudging or
// with cabinet sensors based on mercury switches or plumb bobs.
// The nudge accelerations for these sorts of digital nudge inputs
// are simulated, so they're already free of the analog measurement
// errors that this filter is designed to compensate for.
//
// This filter *might* work with real accelerometers that aren't
// in standard cabinets, such as in mini-cabs or desktop controllers.
// It's designed to mimic the physics of a standard cabinet, so
// using it in another physical setup probably wouldn't emulate
// that setup's natural physical behavior.  But the filter might
// give pleasing results anyway simply because every VP setup is
// ultimately meant to simulate the cabinet experience, so you
// probably want the simulation to behave like a cabinet even when
// it's not actually running in a cabinet physically.
