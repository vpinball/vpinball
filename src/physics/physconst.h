/*
 * NOTE ABOUT VP PHYSICAL UNITS:
 *
 * By convention, one VP length unit (U) corresponds to
 *   1 U = .53975 mm = 5.3975E-4 m,   or   1 m = 1852.71 U
 *
 * For historical reasons, one VP time unit (T) corresponds to
 *   1 T = 10 ms = 0.01 s,            or   1 s = 100 T
 *
 * Therefore, Earth gravity in VP units can be computed as
 *   g  =  9.81 m/s^2  =  1.81751 U/T^2
 */
/*
 * nFozzy explanation:
 * The inch conversion is nice because VP units are somewhat based on inches so you can use fractions:
 * VP units = (inches * 17) / 800
 * Inches = (VP units * 800) / 17
 * 
 * I have to switch between metric and VP units when modeling / rendering and I do that with these scales:
 * CM to VP units: (50 / 2.69875)
 * VP units to CM: (2.69875 / 50)
 * 
 * I’m trying to move to this sort of thing in the future, modeling in pseudo-inches because Maya’s native inch support is for shits
 * Working inches Scale: 1
 * Scale up to CM for rendering: 2.54
 * Scale way up to VPu for export: (1*800)/17
