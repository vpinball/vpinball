   // Forward travel limit.  When we're about to collide with a ball,
   // we'll temporarily set this so the collision location.  We set
   // this in HitTest(), and use it (and reset it) in the next call 
   // to UpdateDisplacements().  This is expressed in absolute
   // position coordinates, so the default value (which allows full
   // forward travel) is m_frameEnd.
   //
   // The purpose of this limit is to fix buggy behavior that can
   // happen when the ball speed after a collision is slower than the
   // plunger speed before the collision.  (In past versions, this
   // scenario wasn't really possible, because the plunger code just
   // gave the ball the same velocity as the plunger at the time of
   // collision.  But this was a bit limiting; the physical process
   // we're modeling is really a transfer of momentum, not velocity.
   // With the addition of the Momentum Transfer property and the new
   // accounting for the relative mass ofthe ball, the ball can now
   // come out of the collision with a slower speed than the plunger
   // had going in.)
   //
   // The bug that this can trigger is that the fast-moving plunger
   // can overtake and shoot past the slow-moving ball.  Left to their
   // own devices, the two objects would just keep moving at their
   // programmed velocities.  If the plunger velocity is faster than
   // the ball after the collision, the plunger can shoot past the
   // ball as though it's not there.  The best way I've found to fix
   // this is to add this extra limit on the travel distance.  This
   // lets us figure where the ball is at the point of collision and
   // explicitly prevent the plunger from going past that until the
   // next displacement update, when the ball will have been moved
   // as well.

   // Mass of the moving parts.  This is in arbitrary units, and serves
   // as a scaling factor in some of the plunger speed calculations.

   // This was probably originally conceived with good intentions of
   // doing a more thorough Physics model, but the way it's actually
   // implemented, it's just a constant scaling factor that probably
   // should have been absorbed into the other arbitrary-units factors
   // to simplify the calculations.  As it is it just makes some of
   // the calculations look more complicated than they really are.
   //
   // It was probably also originally conceived as a user-writable
   // property that table authors could use to fine-tune the physics
   // of an individual plunger object, but it has never been exposed
   // to scripting in any past release.  At this point, assumptions
   // about the scale of this value are pretty well entangled into
   // the plunger physics code, so it would take some analysis of the
   // side effects before we could let table author tweak this.  To
   // emphasize this, the value is now explicitly a constant.  If
   // you want to change the value or make it writable, be aware that
   // you might throw off the balance of the mech vs keyboard plunger
   // strengths - make sure you understand all of the speed and
   // force calculations in hitplunger.cpp before proceeding.

   // instead move under this force.
   float m_pullForce;

   // Reverse impulse.  This models the little bit of force applied
   // to the plunger when a moving ball hits it.  Most of our
   // collisions involve a moving plunger hitting a stationary ball,
   // so we transfer momentum from the plunger to the ball.  But
   // this works both ways; if a stationary plunger is hit by a
   // moving ball, it gets a little bump.  This isn't a huge effect
   // but it's a nice bit of added realism.
   float m_reverseImpulse;

   // Firing mode timer.  When this is non-zero, we're in a Fire
   // event.
   //
   // A Fire event is initiated in one of two ways:
   //
   //  1. The keyboard/script interface calls the Fire method
   //  2. The mechanical plunger moves forware rapidly
   //
   // In either case, we calculate the firing speed based on how
   // far the plunger is pulled back.  Since the plunger is basically
   // a spring, pulling it back and letting it go converts the
   // potential energy in the spring to kinetic energy in the
   // plunger rod; the bottom line is that the final speed of
   // the plunger is proportional to the spring displacement (how
   // far back the plunger was pulled).  So we calculate the speed
   // at the start of the release and allow the rod to move freely
   // at this speed until it strikes the ball.
   //
   // During a Fire event, the simulated plunger is completely
   // disconnected from the mechanical plunger and moves under its
   // own power.  In principle, if we have a mechanical plunger,
   // we *should* be able to track the actual physical motion of
   // the real plunger in real time and just have the software
   // plunger do exactly the same thing.  But this doesn't work
   // in practice because real plungers move much too quickly
   // for our simulation and USB input to keep up with.  Our
   // nominal simulation time base is 10ms, and the USB input
   // updates at 10-30ms cycles.  (USB isn't synchronized with
   // our physics cycle, either, so even if the USB updates were
   // 10ms or faster, we still wouldn't get USB updates on every
   // physics cycle just because the timing wouldn't always align.)
   // In 20ms, a real physical plunger can shoot all the way
   // forward, bounce part way back, and move forward again.  The
   // result is aliasing.
   // 
   // To deal with this, we use heuristics to try to guess when the
   // physical plunger has been released.  When we detect that it
   // has, we simply disconnect the simulated plunger from the
   // physical plunger and let the simulated version move freely
   // under its own spring forces.  We ignore inputs from the analog
   // plunger during this interval.  The real plunger can be expected
   // to come to rest after a full release in about 200ms, so we
   // only leave this mode in effect for a limited time, at which
   // point we start tracking the real plunger position again.

   // lets the player use the natural pull-and-release gesture with

   // and clear this flag.  This lets us fire the events when we're
