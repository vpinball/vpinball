      // The whole point of the event processing is to better estimate
      // the speed of impact when the plunger hits the ball.  When we
      // have speed data from the controller, we presume it's more
      // physically accurate than our synthetic event estimate.

      // Go back through the recent history to find the apex of the

      // reports aren't synchronized to our clock.  In practice the
      // time between USB reports is in the 10-30ms range, which gives
      // us a considerable range of error in calculating an instantaneous
      // speed.
      //
      // So instead of relying on the instantaneous speed alone, now
      // that we're pretty sure a release motion is under way, go back
      // through our recent history to find out where it really
      // started.  Scan the history for monotonically ascending values,
