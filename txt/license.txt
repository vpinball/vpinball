This program now requires FreeImage.DLL in order to load extra image types.
As required by the FreeImage Public License:
If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. (such as this license file)
"The contents of this file are subject to the FreeImage Public License Version 1.0 (the "License"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License. You may obtain a copy of the License at http://home.wxs.nl/~flvdberg/freeimage-license.txt
Software distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" basis, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, either express or implied. See the License for the specific language governing rights and limitations under the License."
No modifications were made to the freeimage.dll file, or internal freeimage source code, so that covers our use of the dll in a free capacity.

It also uses Bass.DLL for loading and playing sound effects and music.
From the website (http://www.un4seen.com/):
BASS is free for non-commercial use.
If you are a non-commercial entity (eg. an individual) and you are not making any money from your product (through sales, advertising, etc),
then you can use BASS in it for free. Otherwise, one of the following licences will be required.
