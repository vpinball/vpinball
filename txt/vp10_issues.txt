Renderer known issues:

*) textboxes don't work properly, especially for high resolutions/scales
*) text decals don't work?
*) stereo 3D is only working soso since the tweaks to the depth buffer range
*) 4xMSAA flickers, thus disabled
*) textures aren't preloaded, can lead to stutter in some cases
*) adaptive vsync always falls back to normal vsync on XP and is hacky implemented on newer windows versions
*) lost devices aren't handled properly (real fullscreen issue only)
