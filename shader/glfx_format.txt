This format was created to reduce the effort of converting the fx shaders of VisualPinball to OpenGL.

2. Structure

Since I wanted to keep it simple ans stupid, the parser itself is (unlike C, C++ or glsl) a linebased and case sensitive
parser. All Lines starting with four slashes (e.g. //// ) changes the output generated for the glsl compiler. Lines 
following ////GLOBAL are used for vertex and fragment shader. Lines following ////VERTEX and /////FRAGMENT are used for
all vertex/fragment shaders. To use code only in one shader use ////vs_notex_main where vs_notex_main is the vertex/fragment
shader you define later in the TECHNIQUES block. Every final shader must contain exactly ONE main() function. Geometry
shaders can be defined with ////GEOMETRY

To add defines into your code set Shader::Defines to a string containing your defines and insert a ////DEFINES block in your glfx file.

Do not use comments starting with //// - this breaks the parser.

3. Converting

3.1 Techniques
DX9 definition of a technique:
technique basic_without_texture_isMetal
{ 
   pass P0 
   { 
      VertexShader = compile vs_3_0 vs_notex_main(); 
      PixelShader = compile ps_3_0 ps_main(1);
   } 
}

without geometry shader is transformed to a single line:

basic_without_texture_isMetal:P0:vs_notex_main():ps_main(1)
or
basic_without_texture_isMetal:P0:vs_notex_main()::ps_main(1)

(note:you can have one or two colons between vertex shader and fragment shader, when you have no geometry shader)

if you want to add a geometry shader:
basic_without_texture_isMetal:P0:vs_main():gs_main():ps_main(1)

Parameters as in ps_main(1) can be defined in the shadercode with %PARAMi% starting with %PARAM0%. Note: If a function is called
with less parameters than defined in the code, the undefined %PARAMi% are not replaced. This will probably not compile.

Multiple passes are possible, just use multiple lines (untested).

3.2 Include files:
Lines matching the pattern '#include "filename"' are parsed at this position. They might also contain ////Blocks. The parsing starts
with the same block state as the main file and after parsing the include file the state is switched back to the last state before #include.

3.3. Converting main functions:
Either use a converter or do it manually:

struct VS_NOTEX_OUTPUT 
{
   float4 pos      : POSITION;
   float4 worldPos_t1x : TEXCOORD0; // pack tex1 into w component of the float4s
   float4 normal_t1y : TEXCOORD1;
};

texture Texture3; // bulb light buffer
sampler2D texSamplerBL : TEXUNIT3 = sampler_state // bulb light/transmission buffer texture
{
	Texture	  = (Texture3);
    MIPFILTER = NONE; //!! ??
    MAGFILTER = LINEAR;
    MINFILTER = LINEAR;
	ADDRESSU  = Clamp;
	ADDRESSV  = Clamp;
};

float4 ps_main(in VS_NOTEX_OUTPUT IN, uniform bool is_metal) : COLOR
{
   const float3 diffuse  = cBase_Alpha.xyz;
   const float3 glossy   = is_metal ? cBase_Alpha.xyz : cGlossy_ImageLerp.xyz*0.08;
   const float3 specular = cClearcoat_EdgeAlpha.xyz*0.08;
   const float  edge     = is_metal ? 1.0 : Roughness_WrapL_Edge_Thickness.z;
   
   const float3 V = normalize(/*camera=0,0,0,1*/-IN.worldPos_t1x.xyz);
   const float3 N = normalize(IN.normal_t1y.xyz);

   //return float4((N+1.0)*0.5,1.0); // visualize normals

   float4 result;
   result.xyz = lightLoop(IN.worldPos_t1x.xyz, N, V, diffuse, glossy, specular, edge, true, is_metal); //!! have a "real" view vector instead that mustn't assume that viewer is directly in front of monitor? (e.g. cab setup) -> viewer is always relative to playfield and/or user definable
   result.a = cBase_Alpha.a;

   [branch] if(cBase_Alpha.a < 1.0) {
      result.a = GeometricOpacity(dot(N,V),result.a,cClearcoat_EdgeAlpha.w,Roughness_WrapL_Edge_Thickness.w);

      if (fDisableLighting_top_below.y < 1.0)
          // add light from "below" from user-flagged bulb lights, pre-rendered/blurred in previous renderpass //!! sqrt = magic
          result.xyz += lerp(sqrt(diffuse)*tex2Dlod(texSamplerBL, float4(float2(0.5*IN.worldPos_t1x.w,-0.5*IN.normal_t1y.w)+0.5, 0.,0.)).xyz*result.a, 0., fDisableLighting_top_below.y); //!! depend on normal of light (unknown though) vs geom normal, too?
   }

   return result;
}

Must be converted to:
////ps_main
#version 330

in vec4 pos;
in vec4 worldPos_t1x;
in vec4 normal_t1y;

in sampler2D Texture3;

out vec4 color;

void main() {
   const vec3 diffuse  = cBase_Alpha.xyz;
   const vec3 glossy   = %PARAM0% ? cBase_Alpha.xyz : cGlossy_ImageLerp.xyz*0.08;
   const vec3 specular = cClearcoat_EdgeAlpha.xyz*0.08;
   const float  edge     = %PARAM0% ? 1.0 : Roughness_WrapL_Edge_Thickness.z;
   
   const vec3 V = normalize(/*camera=0,0,0,1*/-IN.worldPos_t1x.xyz);
   const vec3 N = normalize(IN.normal_t1y.xyz);

   //return vec4((N+1.0)*0.5,1.0); // visualize normals

   vec4 result;
   result.xyz = lightLoop(IN.worldPos_t1x.xyz, N, V, diffuse, glossy, specular, edge, true, %PARAM0%); //!! have a "real" view vector instead that mustn't assume that viewer is directly in front of monitor? (e.g. cab setup) -> viewer is always relative to playfield and/or user definable
   result.a = cBase_Alpha.a;

   if(cBase_Alpha.a < 1.0) {
      result.a = GeometricOpacity(dot(N,V),result.a,cClearcoat_EdgeAlpha.w,Roughness_WrapL_Edge_Thickness.w);

      if (fDisableLighting_top_below.y < 1.0)
          // add light from "below" from user-flagged bulb lights, pre-rendered/blurred in previous renderpass //!! sqrt = magic
          result.xyz += mix(sqrt(diffuse)*textureLod(Texture3, vec2(0.5*IN.worldPos_t1x.w,-0.5*IN.normal_t1y.w)+0.5, 0.0).xyz*result.a, 0., fDisableLighting_top_below.y); //!! depend on normal of light (unknown though) vs geom normal, too?
   }

   color = result;
}

3.4 defines are ignored by the parser, but handeled by the GLSL compiler if they are defined in the glfx file. Passing C/C++ defines from VisualStudio is not possible.

3.5 Conversion help:

float2 => vec2
float3 => vec3
float4 => vec4

tex2Dlod(sampler, vec4) => textureLod(sampler, vec4.xy, vec4.w)
lerp(x,y,s) => mix(x,y,s)
ddx(x) => dFdx(x)
ddy(x) => dFdy(x)
sincos(phi,sp,cp) => {sp=sin(phi);cp=cos(phi);
frac(x) => fract(x)

unchanged:
dot(x,y)
normalize(x)
sqrt(x)
