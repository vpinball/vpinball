# View Setup

VPX offers 2 ways of rendering to the screen:
- using a [perspective camera](#Perspective-camera), this is the default and usual way to render the table when used on a desktop computer,
- using a [window projection](#Window-projection), which is designed to be used insde a cab, eventually with headtracking.



## Perspective camera
The perspective camera is the usual way of defining a view in most games. VPX uses this when the 'View Layout Mode' is set to 'Legacy' or 'Camera'.

'Legacy' is the old way of defining the camera, kept for backward compatibility. The following informations apply to 'Camera' mode only.

The 'camera' view is setup by the following properties:
- Player X/Y/Z is the view position from bottom center of the playfield,
- Look At is the point the player is looking at, defined as a percent of the playfield height (0% is at the lockbar, 100% at the back),
- Field of View is the overall scale,
- Horizontal/Vertical Offset adjust the position of rendered part of the projection,
- Horizontal/Vertical Stretch scales the rendered view (after perspective projection).

The perspective projection (green) is displayed on the screen (blue).

## Window projection
When VPX is used to emulate a pinball inside a cabinet, the player is located on the side of the screen instead of being in front.
The render is also expected to be somewhat different since it is supposed to mislead the viewer into believing there is actually a real playfield 'inside' the screen, eventually using headtracking and/or 3D stereo rendering to increase this perception.

The window projection mode is a new (as of VPX 10.8) mode which tries to emulate this situation.

The 'window' view is setup by the following properties:
- Player X/Y/Z is the view position from bottom center of the playfield,
- Window Top/Bottom X/Y/Z offsets define the position of screen bounds relative to playfield bounds,
- Horizontal/Vertical Offset adjust the position of rendered part of the projection,
- Horizontal/Vertical Stretch scales the rendered view (after perspective projection).

The window projection (green) is displayed on the screen (blue). The projection is parrallel to the screen.

The existing implementation does not perform (yet) perspective distortion compensation. Sadly, this may lead to some distortion at the back of the screen.
