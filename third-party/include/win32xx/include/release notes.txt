About Win32++
-------------
Win32++ is simple and easy to understand framework for developing Win32
applications using C++. It brings an object oriented approach to programming
directly with the Win32 API. Each window created is a C++ class object capable
of having its own window procedure for routing messages.

Win32++ supports the following compilers and development environments:

* Code::Blocks
* Embarcadero Dev-C++
* Embarcadero Rad Studio 11 Community Edition  
* Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015
* Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019
* Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022

* MinGW compiler
* MinGW x64 compiler
* Clang compiler provided with Visual Studio Community 2019 and above.

Win32++ supports the following operating systems

* Windows XP
* Windows 2003 Server
* Windows Vista
* Windows 2008 Server
* Windows 7
* Windows 8
* Windows 8.1
* Windows 2012 Server
* Windows 10
* Windows Server 2016
* Windows Server 2019
* Windows 11
* Windows Server 2022

Getting Started
---------------
Each file download includes the project files for Dev-C++, CodeBlocks and the
various compilers from Microsoft. CodeBlocks is an IDE (Integrated Development
Environment) that supports GNU GCC, Borland Developer Studio 2006 and Microsoft
C++ Toolkit 2003.

You  can start with one of the sample programs, and add your code. Alternatively
you can start with the projects and sample code provided in the "new projects"
folder.

For additional information on getting started, refer to the help included
in the documentation.
