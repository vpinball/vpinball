Version 10.0
============
This version updates the library to utilize features available in C++11 and
C++14. Win32++ now uses the unique_ptr and shared_ptr smart pointers. These
smart pointers are used in place of Shared_Ptr when adding new instances of
CTab, CMDIChild, CPropertySheet and CDocker.

There is now no requirement to use any raw pointers when allocating memory in
code that uses the Win32++ library. Users of Win32++ are now free to avoid 
the use of both new and delete, and instead wrap all memory allocations in
smart pointers. This helps to avoid memory leaks and improve exception safety
in code that uses Win32++.

The C++ compilers that Win32++ supports have changed. Older compilers that
don't support C++14 are no longer supported.

Win32++ version 10.0 only supports the Windows XP and later operating systems. 
Win32++ version 9.6.1 is the latest version to support the operating systems
older than Windows XP. Win32++ version 9.6.1 supports Win95 through to
Windows 11.


Incompatibilities with previous versions
----------------------------------------
The following functions now return a unique_ptr instead of a raw pointer:
* CDocker::NewDockFromID
* CTabbedMDI::NewMDIChildFromID

Code that overrides of these function need to return a unique_ptr as well.
For example:

  DockPtr CMainFrame::NewDockerFromID(int /*id*/)
  {
      DockPtr docker;
      switch(id)
      {
      case ID_CLASSES:
          docker = std::make_unique<CDockClasses>();
          break;
      case ID_FILES:
          docker = std::make_unique<CDockFiles>();
          break;
      default:
          TRACE("Unknown Dock ID\n");
          break;
      }
      return docker;
  }


New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
Users can now add new instances of the following classes as smart pointers instead
of raw pointers for CDocker, CMDIChild, CPropertySheet and CTab.

Other changes include:
 * Updated CDocker. Each new CDocker object is stored as a unique_ptr.
 * Updated CMDIFrame. Each new CMDIChild is stored as a unique_ptr.
 * Updated CMDITab. Each new CMDITab object stored as a unique_ptr.
 * Updated CPropertySheet. Each new CPropertyPage object is stored as a unique_ptr.
 * Updated CTab. Each new CTab object is stored as a unique_ptr.
 * Updated CDC. CDC now uses a shared_ptr for its reference counting.
 * Updated CGDIObject. CGDIObject now uses a shared_ptr for its reference counting.
 * Updated CMenu. CMenu now uses a shared_ptr for its reference counting.
 * Updated CImageList. CImageList now uses a shared_ptr for its reference counting.

* The values for WINVER and related macros are now set to values suitable for 
  Windows 10 and Windows 11 by Win32++. Specifying different values for these macros
  before including wincore.h is no longer supported. Win32++ version 10 supports
  all operating systems Windows XP and later irrespective of the values of these
  version macros.

demonstrate how to use the Microsoft Edge WebView2 control in a Win32++
application.

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added the EdgeBrowser sample. This sample uses the Microsoft Edge
  WebView2 control to render the Microsoft Edge browser in a window. It
  demonstrates a simple way to render a Microsoft Edge browser in a view
  window.

* Added the EdgeBrowserEx sample. This sample uses the Microsoft Edge WebView2
  control to display tabs and render the Microsoft Edge browser within those
  tabs. This sample also demonstrates features such as managing favourites
  and browser history.

* Updated CDC. CDC::SelectObject now keeps the selected object in scope. There
  is no longer any need to select the old object back into the device context
  when SelectObject is used.

Changes in Detail

Modified CDC::SelectPalette                               returns CPalette


Version 9.3
===========
This version improves the support for high resolution monitors by automatically
adjusting the size of the frame's toolbar bitmaps and menu icons appropriately.
A number of functions have been added to make supporting high resolution
monitors easier (see below). 

This version also provides support for per-monitor(v2) DPI awareness.
Per-monitor DPI awareness allows applications to maintain their visual quality
when they are moved between monitors with different Dots Per Inch (DPI)
settings.

The new FrameEx sample demonstrates the use of PNG resources instead of bitmap
resources for the toolbar and menu images. 

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* The toolbar bitmaps are automatically scaled up to a size appropriate for
  the frame window's DPI. Bitmaps that are appropriate for lower resolution
  monitors are be scaled up for use on higher resolution monitors without
  a noticeable loss of visual quality.

* The menu icon bitmaps are automatically scaled up to fit the menu item.
  Note that menu icon bitmaps are not scaled down to fit the menu item, as 
  that would result in poor image quality. If the menu item images specified
  in the frame's SetupMenuItemIcons are too big to fit in the menu item,
  the menu icons are not displayed.

* Frames support per monitor DPI awareness by resizing themselves to the 
  size recommended by the WM_DPICHANGED message in the OnDpiChanged function.
  They also automatically adjust the toolbar images, menu icons, and statusbar
  fonts when the frame window is moved between monitors with different DPI
  settings.  

* Dockers and docking frames call OnDpiChanged and OnDpiChangedBeforeParent
  in response to WM_DPICHANGED and WM_DPICHANGED_BEFOREARENT to rearrange
  dockers after a DPI change occurs. View windows should handle the
  WM_DPICHANGEDBEFOREPARENT message if they need to account for DPI 
  changes.  
  
* CResizer supports per monitor DPI awareness by repositioning the child
  windows when the WM_DPICHANGED or WM_DPICHANGED_BEFOREPARENT message is
  handled.

* Added the FrameEx sample.
  The FrameEx sample uses PNG images instead of bitmaps for the toolbar 
  and menu item images. As PNG images scale better than bitmaps, this approach
  is better for applications supporting Per Monitor DPI and high resolution
  monitors.

About high resolution monitor support
-------------------------------------
Modern monitors can now use scaling factors of 400% or more. Applications that
look good with scaling factors of 100% or 150% may not look good at higher
scaling factors. It will often be necessary to adjust the image-list for
list-view and tree-view controls and adjust the fonts used by other windows
to cater for larger scaling factors.

Win32++ provides the following functions for high resolution monitor support.
::GetWindowDpi
CWnd::DpiScaleFont
CWnd::DpiScaleInt
CWnd::DpiScaleLogFont
CWnd::DpiScaleRect
CWnd::DpiScaleUpBitmap

The GetWindowDpi function retrieves the window's current DPI. We can also
call GetWindowDpi(HWND_DESKTOP) to retrieve the system DPI, and the desktop's
DPI when per monitor dpi awareness is enabled.

The various DpiScaleXXX functions take values that are appropriate for a 
a scaling factor of 100% and scale them up to the appropriate values for
the current window's Dots Per Inch (DPI).

About per monitor dpi aware v2
------------------------------
Per monitor dpi aware v2 is a feature that allows applications to maintain
their visual quality when moved between monitors with different DPI settings.
Applications may appear blurry when moved between monitors with different DPI
settings unless per monitor dpi aware v2 is enabled. Per monitor dpi aware v2
is supported on later versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11.

To add per-monitor dpi aware v2 to your application, use a manifest that
includes the per monitor dpi aware v2 entry, such as "PerMonitorV2.manifest"
provided in many of the samples. The manifest should be specified in the
application's resource script, often called "resource.rc". You may also need
to handle the WM_DPICHANGED_BEFOREPARENT message in view windows if they 
require special DPI handling.

If per monitor dpi aware v2 is enabled, a WM_DPICHANGED message is sent to the
top level windows after the DPI change occurs. That usually occurs when the 
window is moved between monitors, but can also occur as a result of a settings
change. A WM_DPICHANGED_BEFOREPARENT to all of the top level window's child and
descendant windows before the WM_DPICHANGED message is sent. A 
WM_DPICHANGED_AFTERPARENT message is is sent to all of the top level window's
child and descendant windows After the WM_DPICHANGED is sent.

The following messages are sent when the application's manifest specifies per
monitor dpi aware V2:

WM_GETDPISCALEDSIZE
Sent to the top level window before the DPI change occurs. The WPARAM
contains the new DPI.

WM_DPICHANGED
Sent to top level windows after a DPI change occurs. The LPARAM contains a 
pointer to rect that provides the suggested new size of the window. 

WM_DPICHANGED_BEFOREPARENT
Sent before the DPI change to all child windows and descendants of the top
level window that is undergoing a DPI change.

WM_DPICHANGED_AFTERPARENT
Sent after the DPI change to all child windows and descendants of the top
level window that is undergoing a DPI change.

WM_SETTINGCHANGE
Sent when the user manually changes the display settings.

Version 9.2
===========

This version provides support for dark mode and provides a sample
that demonstrates how to implement dark mode for a frame application.

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added support for colored text in the status bar.
  CFrame now uses owner draw to render the status bar, allowing different
  colored text to be displayed. The StatusBarTheme struct has been extended
  to allow the status bar text color to be specified. The Themes sample 
  demonstrates the use of different colored text in the status bar.

* Added support for dark mode.
  CFrame now provides support for dark mode by providing the option to use a
  dark menu. This can be used to develop an application with an appropriate
  visual style for dark mode when combined with a black Win32++ theme. Refer
  to the black theme in the Themes sample, and also the DarkMode sample.

* Added the DarkModeFrame sample.
  This samples demonstrates how to make a Win32++ application dark mode aware.
  It uses the Windows App API which is an optional feature that can be 
  installed with Visual Studio Community 2022. This sample detects when the
  Windows theme is using dark mode, and adjusts the frame's theme accordingly.
  The sample also uses a dialog that supports dark mode to display the 
  information about the application. 
  This samples requires Windows 10 or later.

Version 9.1
===========

This version improves support for high resolution monitors by accepting a
range of icon sizes used for menus, tab controls and dock containers.

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Updated the images for menus used by CFrame and CDockFrame.
  - Win32++ now supports a range of image sizes displayed in the popup menu for
    CFrame and CDockFrame. The GetMenuIconHeight function returns the
    appropriate height of these images in pixels (16, 24, 32 etc.). The 
    framework will automatically scale the toolbar images down to a size
    suitable for the popup menu for the toolbar bitmap with a resource ID of
    IDW_MAIN. Alternatively you can provide icons with multiple image sizes as
    demonstrated in the samples.

* Updated the ListView sample.
  - An edit control has been added to provide support the in-place editing of
    the List-View's and subitems. A List-View control doesn't have built-in
    support for the editing of subitems.
  - Support for sorting by column has been added. To sort a column in ascending
    or descending order, click on the column in the list-view's header.

Changes in Detail
-----------------
Added    CComboBox::GetComboBoxInfo
Added    CEdit::GetTextLength
Added    CFrameT::GetMenuIconHeight

Renamed  CMenuBar::GetMenu   to   CMenuBar::GetBarMenu
Renamed  CMenuBar::SetMenu   to   CMenuBar::SetupMenuBar


Version 9.0
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Updated thread support. Thread classes now use the CThreadT class template.
  Threads that support windows continue to use CWinThread. Worker threads now
  use CWorkThread. 
  CWinThread inherits from CThreadT<CMessagePump>.
  CWorkThread inherits from CThreadT<CObject>.

* The values for WINVER and related macros now default to values suitable for 
  Windows 10 and Windows 11. Different values can be specified before including
  wincore.h if required. These values can be specified in stdafx.h by including
  targetver.h as shown in the samples. Visual Studio 6 will require WINVER to
  be set to values appropriate for Win95 or Win98.

* Updated CDialog
  Added a default constructor. Use either the SetDialogTemplate, 
  SetDialogResource or SetDialogFromID functions to specify the dialog if the
  default constructor is used.

* Updated the MenuTheme struct.
  A clrText member has been added to the MenuTheme struct to define the color of
  menubar text. This is now used to set the menubar text color to white for the
  BLACK theme in the themes sample.

* Added the DialogTemplate sample.
  This sample demonstrates how to search for the resources embedded in a
  windows executable or dll file. The user can select a dialog from the list
  of dialogs found in the file. The dialog template of the selected dialog is
  displayed in a rich edit view as an unsigned char array in a manner that can
  be saved to a header file. The program then creates the dialog from the 
  displayed dialog template and displays it.

* Added the PrintDialogEx sample.
  This sample upgrades the Notepad sample. Where the Notepad sample used
  CPrintDialog to display the print dialog, this sample uses CPrintDialogEx
  to display the print dialog. This sample supports printing individual
  pages, as well as multiple page ranges. It also supports printing multiple
  copies, with or without collating. A footer displaying the page number is
  added to the bottom of the printed page.

* Added the Titlebar sample.
  This sample demonstrates how to customize the title bar of a window. It sets
  the title bar's color and draws the minimize, maximize and close buttons.
  The sample uses CMenuBar to display a menu in the title bar.

* Added the TitlebarFrame sample.
  This sample demonstrates how to use a customized title bar with a frame.
  It demonstrates the frame in two modes: mini-frame and full-frame.


Version 8.9.1
=============

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added CPrintDialogEx.
  - The CPrintDialogEx class uses PrintDlgEx to display a property sheet
    that allows the user to select the printer to use.
    Requires Windows 2000 or newer ( WINVER >= 0500 ).

 * Updated CDC.
  - A CDC restores its device context to its original state when its last
    copy is destroyed, unless the Detach function is used to detach it.
    Use Detach to keep changes made to the device context, such as when
    handling WM_CTLCOLORBTN, WM_CTLCOLOREDIT, WM_CTLCOLORDLG,
    WM_CTLCOLORLISTBOX, WM_CTLCOLORSCROLLBAR or WM_CTLCOLORSTATIC.
    Detach is not required unless we need to keep the changes made to the
    device context.

 * Updated CString.
  - Added << operator overload. It accepts integers, doubles, characters,
    character arrays and CStrings. Use as follows:
    CString str;
    int x = 5;
    double y = 3.14;
    str << "Equation: " << x << " + " << y << " = " << x+y << '\n';

 * Added ListView sample.


Version 8.9
===========

This version adds support for the Clang compiler, and improves the handling
of error messages.


New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Adds support for the Clang C++ compiler available with Microsoft's
   Visual Studio Community 2019.

* The error messages displayed when an exception is raised have been moved to
  CWinApp as a set of virtual member functions. These can be overridden to
  support other languages if required.

* A CResource exception is now thrown in additional circumstances:
  - CMenu throws a CResourceException if the menu can't be created.
  - CImageList throws a CResourceException if the image list can't be created.
  - CDC throws a CResourceException the selection of a GDI object fails.

* Updated the manifests used in the samples.
   The manifests now use GDI scaling. This provides better support for dual
   monitors, and monitors with high resolution.


Version 8.8
===========

This version adds the BrowserATL, MovieShow and WinPlot samples. It also adds
support for Code::Blocks version 20.03.


New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added CWnd::Close
   This function can be used to close an application in the recommended way, by
   sending a WM_CLOSE message to the main window. The OnClose virtual function
   is then called when the window is closed. The default behaviour of OnClose
   destroys the window. OnClose can be overridden to perform other tasks in
   addition to, or instead of destroying the window.

* Added MovieShow sample
   This sample implements a video library manager for video files. The code
   assumes the video files have already have the meta data for the movie. The
   meta data includes the movie name, actors, genre, plot description, cover
   image, etc.

* Added WinPlot sample
   This sample plots a user specified function in the window.
   The plot is resized when the window is resized.

* Added BrowserATL sample
   This sample demonstrates the interoperability between Win32++ and ATL.
   It does the same thing as the Browser sample, except that it uses ATL.

* Updated the manifest file in the samples.
   The manifest file now provides support for Windows 10 features, and
   support for Per-Monitor DPI Awareness, version 2. GetWinVersion now
   reports a value of 3000 for Windows 10.


Version 8.7
===========

This version adds print preview support to the framework, and support for
Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019.


New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added CPrintPreview.
  The CPrintPreview displays a preview of the print job before it is sent to
  the printer.

  To use CPrintPreview, do the following:
  1) Declare CPrintPreview as CMainFrame's member, specifying the source's
     class as the template type. The source is where the PrintPage function
     resides.
  2) Use SetSource to specify to where to call the PrintPage function.
  3) Declare a PrintPage function in the source for printing and previewing:
      void  PrintPage(CDC& dc, UINT page);
  4) Call CPrintPreview's DoPrintPreview(HWND ownerWindow, UINT maxPage = 1)
     to initiate the print preview.
  5) Create the preview window, and swap it into the frame's view.
  6) Handle the UWM_PREVIEWCLOSE message to swap back to the default view when
     the preview closes.

  CPrintPreview supports all print jobs. Any printing using the PrintPage
  function can be previewed. Refer to the following samples:
   Frame; INIFrame; FastGDI; Notepad; PrintPreview; and Scribble.

* Added CHGlobal class.
  The CHGlobal class is a wrapper for a global memory handle. It automatically
  frees the global memory when it goes out of scope.

* Extended the CGlobalLock class.
  The CGlobalLock class is used to automatically lock and unlock global memory.
  This can be useful when working with printers. Global memory is used to hold
  memory for DEVNAMES and DEVMODE structures.


Version 8.6
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* m_hWnd is no longer a protected member variable of CWnd. Use either *this or
  GetHwnd() to access the window handle association associated with the CWnd.
  Eliminating protected member variables keeps the code robust, and is
  consistent with good software design.

* The programming style has been updated, and the Hungarian notation has
  been removed. The m_ prefix for member variables has been retained, as
  has a p prefix for pointers.

* Windows API functions that have been flagged as deprecated by Microsoft
  because of security issues have been replaced by their more modern equivalents
  for the compilers that support them. Warnings relating to deprecated code are
  no longer disabled by the library. If your code issues warnings related to
  deprecated code, you can disable them, but updating your code might be a
  better option.

* Three new functions have been supplied to guard against buffer overruns when
  copying strings. They allow the size of the destination buffer to be specified,
  much like strcpy_s and wcscpy_s. The new functions are:
  StrCopyA    Copies a char string to a buffer of specified size.
  StrCopyW    Copies a wide string to a buffer of specified size.
  StrCopy     Copies a TCHAR string to a buffer of specified size.

* Added CEvent
* Added CMutex
* Added CSemaphore
* Updated CSocket
 - now also supports async sockets
 - added NetClientAsync sample
 - added NetServerAsync sample
* Updated frames
 - Additional toolbars have better support for disabled buttons.
 - Optimised the creation of the image list for disabled menu icons.
 - Optimised AddMenuIcon (the disabled image-list isn't recreated unnecessarily).
 - Added UseStatusBar option for OnCreate.
 - Relaxed restrictions on size of images for menu icons. This provides better
    support for larger screen scaling available on windows 10 for DPI aware apps.
 - Added VK_INSERT to the set of keys checked by the keyboard hook.

* Updated CImageList
* CRichEdit now supports RichEdit version 4.1 if available (XP and above).
* The Notepad sample now supports UTF-8.
* Added 5 new CResizer alignments for controls. They can be aligned as follows:
  - topleft:      Positions top left
  - topright:     Positions top right
  - bottomleft:   Positions bottom left
  - bottomright:  Positions bottom right
  - center:       Positions proportionally
  - leftcenter:   Positions proportionally along the left side
  - rightcenter:  Positions proportionally along the right side
  - topcenter:    Positions proportionally along the top side
  - bottomcenter: Positions proportionally along the bottom side


Version 8.5
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added CFileFind class
  The CFileFind provides a means of finding one or more files that match
  a search string. Information can be extracted from each file found.

* Added CFolderDialog class
  This class wraps SHBrowseForFolder to display a dialog for choosing a folder.

* Updated the CFile class
  The following function now throw an exception on failure:
    - Rename
    - Remove
    - Flush
    - Close
    - SetLength
    - LockRange
    - UnlockRange

* Updated the status bar
  - A gripper is added if the parent window has the WS_THICKFRAME style.

* Updated docking frames
  - A CDockContainer can now be used as the view window for docking frames
    (inherited from CDockFrame for example). This container can have zero
    or more tabs. The DockContainer sample now uses a CDockContainer as the
    frame's view window.

* Updated frames
  - The sizes of the indicators in the status bar are determined more accurately.
  - A toolbar bitmap is now optional (icons can be used instead).
  - A menu for the frame is now optional.
  - The menu arrow button is now rendered correctly on Windows 10.

* Updated CComboBox and CListBox
  - Added a virtual CompareItem function. Override this function to specify
    the order in which items are added for owner drawn controls.


Version 8.4
===========

This version of Win32++ introduces class templates to provide the different
types of frames. Frames can support a Single Document Interface (SDI) or a
Multiple Document Interface (MDI). They might or might not support docking,
and they might or might not support the Ribbon Framework. Each of these
optional features are provided using class templates.


New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added CFrameT template class
   - CFrame now inherits from CFrameT<CWnd>.
   - CDockFrame now inherits from CFrameT<CDocker>.
   To use these classes, inherit your CMainFrame from either CFrame or
   CDockFrame as before.

* Added CMDIFrameT class template
   - CMDIFrame now inherits from CMDIFrameT<CFrame>
   - CMDIDockFrame now inherits from CMDIFrameT<CDockFrame>
   To use these classes, inherit your CMainFrame from either CMDIFrame
   or CMDIDockFrame as before.

* Added CRibbonFrameT class template.
   This class template adds a ribbon to any frame.
   - CRibbonFrame inherits from CRibbonFrameT<CFrame>
   - CRibbonDockFrame inherits from CRibbonFrameT<CDockFrame>
   - CRibbonMDIFrame inherits from CRibbonFrameT<CMDIFrame>
   - CRibbonMDIDockFrame inherits from CRibbonFrameT<CMDIDockFrame>
   To use these class, inherit your CMainFrame from either CRibbonFrame,
   CRibbonDockFrame, CRibbonMDIFrame or CRibbonMDIDockFrame.
   Notes:
    1) To compile code using the Ribbon Framework you will need a Microsoft
       compiler. Visual Studio Community 2013 (or later) is recommended, but
       older Microsoft compilers can be used with the Windows 7 SDK.
    2) The Ribbon Framework only runs on Windows 7 or later operating systems.
       If the code is run on an earlier operating system, it reverts back to a
       menu and toolbar.

* Added CScrollView
  The CScrollView class adds scrolling to a CWnd used as a view window. To
  use this class, inherit the View window from CScrollView and use the
  SetScrollSizes function to enable scrolling. No change needs to be made
  to the code in OnDraw to allow it to be scrolled. CScrollView is used in
  the FastGDI and Picture samples.

* The CMetaFile and CEnhMetaFile classes have been added to the framework.
 - CMetaFile wraps a HMETAFILE. CMetaFile can be used anywhere a HMETAFILE can
   be used. CMetatFile objects are reference counted, so they can be safely
   copied and returned from functions. CMetatFile automatically deletes
   the HMETAFILE when the last copy of the CMetaFile object goes out of scope.
   The CMetaFileDC::Close function returns a CMetaFile object.

 - CEnhMetaFile wraps a HENHMETAFILE. CEnhMetaFile can be used anywhere a
   HENHMETAFILE can be used. CEnhMetaFile objects are reference counted,
   so they can be safely copied and returned from functions. CEnhMetaFile
   automatically deletes the HENHMETAFILE when the last copy of the
   CEnhMetaFile object goes out of scope. The CMetaFileDC::CloseEnhanced
   function returns a CEnhMetaFile object.

* Renamed the text conversion typedefs.
   This allows Win32++ to be used with ATL.

* Added the following samples.
 1) Animation sample.
   This sample demonstrates how to use an animation control in a dialog.

 2) ContextHelp sample.
   Displays help topics from a chm file. The help topics are chosen based on
   the current mouse position.

 3) MetaFile sample.
   This sample demonstrates how to create and display an enhanced metafile.

 4) RibbonMDIFrame sample.
   This sample demonstrates how to use the Window 7 ribbon with a MDI frame.

 5) ScrollTextFile sample.
   This sample displays the contents of a text file in a scrollable window.

 6) ToolTips sample.
   This sample demonstrates how to add tooltips to controls in a modal dialog.


Version 8.3
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added PrintPreview sample
   This sample extends the NotePad sample by adding support for Print Preview.
   The techniques demonstrated here can be used in your own applications to
   provide a print preview.

* Added CRibbonDockFrame.
   This class adds docking to a frame window that supports the Ribbon UI.
   A RibbonDockFrame sample has been added to demonstrate CRibbonDockFrame.

* Updated CString
 - CString and the text conversion classes can now be used independently of
   the rest of the framework.
 - Added CString::Assign. This function is used to assign a specified number
   of characters to a CString. The assigned string can contain null characters.

* Updated CFrame and CMDIFrame
 - SetView can now be used to switch between multiple views for frames
   and MDI children.
 - Added a virtual SetupMenuIcons function. This functions adds the set of
   ToolBar images to the icons used in menus. Override this to add additional
   icons to the menus.
 - Updated MRU support.
   The display of long file names in the MRU uses the same approach as Visual
   Studio.
 - Modified default theme colors for Windows 8 and Windows 10.

* Updated CDocker
  - SetView can now be used to switch between multiple views for CDocker and
    CDockContainer.
  - Improved the way the active docker is determined. This is now implemented
    without a timer.

* Updated CDC
  - Additional overrides for CDC::SelectObject to allow this function to be used
    without casting. For example:
      CPen Pen(PS_SOLID, 1, RGB(255, 0, 0));
      CPen OldPen = dcMem.SelectObject(pen);
  - GDI resources created by CDC are managed better. Old GDI resources are now
    destroyed immediately, rather than when the CDC is de-constructed.

* Updated CPropertyPage
  - OnApply, OnSetActive OnWizardBack, OnWizardFinish and OnWizardNext now return
    a BOOL, making them simpler to use.


Version 8.2
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added support for Common Dialogs
The following common dialogs have been added to the framework:
 - CColorDialog
 - CFindReplacDialog
 - CFileDialog
 - CFontDialog
 - CPrintDialog
 - CPageSetupDialog

The CPrintDialog and CPageSetupDialog classes share global memory for
their hDevMode and hDevNames handles. This global memory persists after
the CPrintDialog and CPageSetupDialog objects are destructed, and is
managed by CWinApp. There is no need for the user to manually lock,
unlock or free the hDevMode and hDevNames memory.
Note: CFile::OpenFileDialog and CFile::SaveFileDialog have been removed.
Use CFiledDialog for these instead.

* Updated CFrame
 - GetInitValues and SetInitValues have been added to conveniently store
   and retrieve a set of values from the registry or an INI file. These
   functions replace a set of functions that stored and retrieved these
   values individually.

* Added GetAppDataPath
 - This function returns the path to the AppData folder. Applications
   can create folders within AppData to store their data.

* Updated samples
 - The INIFrame sample now stores the settings file in the AppData folder.
   It is important for applications to store values in the AppData folder
   on the more modern operating systems (Vista and above) as these don't
   allow the user to write to the "Program Files" folder.

* "New Projects" folder
 - This folder has been relocated to the samples folder. It is now more
   convenient to use this as the starting point for your new projects.

* Added messages to retrieve the CWnd pointer. SendMessage can now be used
  to retrieve the window's CWnd pointer as an alternative to GetCWndPtr.
 - UWM_GETCWND returns the CWnd*
 - UWM_GETCFRAME returns the CWnd* for any object inherited from CFrame
 - UWM_GETCDOCKER returns the CWnd* for any object inherited from CDocker
 - UWM_GETCDOCKCONTAINER returns the CWnd* for any object inherited from CDockContainer
 - UWM_GETCTABBEDMDI returns the CWnd* for any object inherited from CTabbedMDI
 - UWM_GETCTOOLBAR returns the CWnd* for any object inherited from CToolBar


Version 8.1
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added DDX/DDV
  CDataExchange provides support for Dialog Data eXchange(DDX) and Dialog Data
  Validation(DDV). The CDataExchange class has a set of DDX and DDV member
  functions which perform the data exchange and validation for different types
  of controls. Typically this is used for controls in dialogs, but controls in
  any window support DDX and DDV.

  To use CDataExchange, perform the following steps:
   - Override DoDataExchange and specify the appropriate DDX and DDV functions.
   - Call UpdateData(FALSE) to initialize the controls and assign their values.
     This is typically done in the dialog's OnInitDialog function.
   - Call UpdateData(TRUE) to validate and retrieve the control data.

  Refer to the DDXDemo sample for a demonstration of how to use CDataExchange

* Extended CString
   CString is now based on the CStringT template.
   CStringA is defined as CStringT<CHAR>. It is an ANSI only version of CString
   CStringW is defined as CStringT<WCHAR>. It is a UNICODE only version of CString.
   CString inherits from CStringT<TCHAR>. In addition to accepting TCHAR when
   constructed, it also accepts CHAR and WCHAR. It is backwards compatible with
   the previous implementation of CString.
   Additional features added to CStringA, CStringW and CString:
   - Added operator + support for ints and doubles.
   - Added operator += support for ints and doubles.
   - Added operator = support for ints and doubles.

* Updated CArchive
   - Added the ability to archive char and wchar character arrays. The abilty
     to archive TCHAR character arrays is retained.
   - Added the ability to archive CStringA and CStringW. The ability to
     archive CString is retained.

* Added CDockFrame.
   Inherit your CMainFrame from CDockFrame to add docking capabilities to normal
   Single Document Interface (SDI) frames. Frames which don't require docking
   capabilities should inherit from CFrame. The use of CFrame instead of
   CDockFrame results in as smaller executable file size.
   Refer to the Dock, DockContainer, DockTabbeedMDI and Splitter samples for
   a demonstration of CDockFrame.

* Added CMDIDockFrame
   Inherit your CMainMDIFrame from CMDIDockFrame to add docking capabilities to
   Multiple Document Interface (MDI) frames. MDI Frames which don't require docking
   capabilities should inherit from CMDIFrame. The use of CMDIFrame instead of
   CMDIDockFrame results in a smaller executable file size.
   Refer to the DockMDI sample for a demonstration of CMDIDockFrame.

* Updated the exception handling
   - Added CException             ( inherits from std::exception )
   - Added CFileException         ( inherits from CException )
   - Added CNotSupportedException ( inherits from CException )
   - Added CUserException         ( inherits from CException )
   - Updated CWinException        ( inherits from CException )

* Updated CWnd
   - Added OnPaint virtual function. OnPaint calls OnDraw for generic windows,
     but not for window controls. Users can now override OnPaint to draw to
     window controls as an alternative to custom draw or owner draw.
   - Added DoDataExchange and UpdatedData to support CDataExchange.

* Updated the documentation
   - Added 'Dialog Data Exchange (DDX and DDV)  to Using Win32++
   - Added 'Doc View Model'                     to Using Win32++
   - Added 'Serialization with CArchive'        to Using Win32++
   - Extended 'CString'                         in Using Win32++


Version 8.0.1
==============

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Win32++ is now system DPI (Dots Per Inch) aware.
  The manifest for each sample has been updated to support DPI aware.
  The size of the CFrame status bar and menu elements are now adjusted to
  accommodate the system's DPI settings.

  Users may wish to detect the current DPI and their GUI layout accordingly
  to support different DPIs. Refer to:
  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn469266%28v=vs.85%29.aspx


Version 8.0
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added CArchive.
  CArchive provides a convenient means of saving and restoring an application's
  data, by streaming the data to and from a file.

* Added CObject
  CObject provides the Serialize virtual function which is used by CArchive.
  Any class inherited from CObject can override Serialize to customize the
  way its data is saved in the archive. CWnd and CWinThread inherit from
  CObject. Classes created by the user can inherit from CObject as well.

* Added CRegKey.
  CRegKey is a wrapper for functions used to access and modify the registry.

* Added CTime and CTimeSpan
  CTime manages the display of date and time.
  CTimeSpan calculates the interval between times and dates.

* Added  GetCommandLineArgs
  This function provides access to the command line arguments. They are
  returned in a vector of CString.

* Added VERIFY macro
  In debug mode, VERIFY asserts if the expression evaluates to zero
  In release mode, VERIFY evaluates the expression, but doesn't assert

* Renamed Header files
  The header files located in the include directory have been prefixed
  with wxx_ . This was done to avoid potential name conflicts with header
  files from other libraries.

* Updated CFile
  - The nOpenFlags used in CFile::Open, and CFile's constructor continue to
    support the same file creation modes as before, but now support additional
    modes as well.
    Possible nOpenFlag values: CREATE_NEW, CREATE_ALWAYS, OPEN_EXISTING,
        OPEN_ALWAYS, TRUNCATE_EXISTING
     Default value: OPEN_EXISTING | modeReadWrite
     The following modes are also supported:
    - CFile::modeCreate         Same as CREATE_ALWAYS.
    - CFile::modeNoTruncate     Same as OPEN_ALWAYS.
    - CFile::modeRead           Requests read access only.
    - CFile::modeWrite          Requests write access only.
    - CFile::modeReadWrite      Requests read and write access.
    - CFile::shareExclusive     Denies read and write access to all others.
    - CFile::shareDenyWrite     Denies write access to all others.
    - CFile::shareDenyRead      Denies read access to all others.
    - CFile::shareDenyNone      No sharing restrictions.
    - CFile now throws an exception under the following circumstances
    - Failure to read from a file.
    - Failure to write to a file.
    - Failure to open the file in CFile's constructor.


Version 7.9
===========

Overview
--------
This version of Win32++ moves away from the use of pointers. Where before we
would use pointers to objects in Win32++ function calls, we now use the objects
directly. The USE_OBSOLETE_CODE macro has been provided in this version to make
code migration easier. Even with this macro defined, you will need to use
non-pointer arguments in Win32++ function calls.

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* The FromHandle method of creating temporary CWnds has been obsoleted.
The FromHandle approach has been replaced. CWnd member functions which
previously returned a CWnd pointer(CWnd*) now return CWnd.
Coding examples: (The GetParent function now returns a CWnd)
 GetParent().SendMessage(SomeMessage, wParam, lParam);
 HWND hWnd = GetParent(); // retrieve the parent window's HWND

* The FromHandle for the other types has been obsoleted as well. This includes:
  - CBitmap::FromHandle
  - CBrush::FromHandle
  - CDC::FromHandle
  - CFont::FromHandle
  - CPalette:: FromHandle
  - CPen::FromHandle
  - CRgn::FromHandle

* Many functions which previously used a CWnd* argument now use a HWND
argument. This has the following advantages:
 - These functions can be used directly for a HWND, CWnd or CWnd pointer.
 - We no longer have to needlessly create temporary CWnds.
Coding examples: (the Create function now has a HWND argument)
 CWnd MyCWnd;
 MyCWnd.Create(Some_CWnd);   // Another CWnd called Some_CWnd is the parent window
 MyCWnd.Create(*this);       // This CWnd is the parent window. (dereferenced pointer)
 MyCWnd.Create(GetHwnd());   // This CWnd is the parent window.
 MyCwnd.Create(GetParent()); // The parent of this CWnd is the parent window
 MyCWnd.Create(Some_HWND);   // A window with the specified HWND is the parent window
 MyCWnd.Create();            // The created window has no parent window

 Note: CWnd has operator overloading. We can use the CWnd object in place
 of its corresponding HWND anywhere in code.

* Many functions which previously used pointers to other Win32++ classes
now also use the relevant handle instead. These include member functions for
CDC, CBitmap, CBrush, CFont, CPalette, CPen, CRgn, CImageList and CMenu.
Each of these classes have operator overloading, so the class object can be
used instead of the handle.

* CDC, CBrush, CBitmap, CFont, CPalette, CPen, CRgn, CMenu and CImageList.
 - These classes destroy the resource they manage when their destructor is
   called, but only if Win32++ created it. This allows us to attach resources
   provided by the operating system (HDCs, HFONTS, HIMAGELISTS etc.) without
   having to detach them later to prevent them from being destroyed.
 - These classes can be re-used. There is no need to detach the current
   handle before assigning a new one.
 - These classes use reference counting, so they can be safely copied. This
   allows them to be returned by value from functions.


Version 7.8
===========

New Features and enhancements
-----------------------------
* Updated CDC
   - Added palette support.
   - Added path support.
   - Added MaskBlt and TransparentBlt functions
   - Now able to retrieve GDI objects currently selected in the device context.

Version 7.7
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Frames now directly support docking
   Previously CFrames implemented docking through the view window. Now CFrame
   inherits from CDocker and implements docking directly. Users can now add
   dockers to a frame that doesn't use a docker as the view window.
   Alternatively users can implement docking through the view window as before.

* MDI Frames directly support docking
   Dockers can now be added to classic MDI Frames. Code to add dockers to a
   MDI frame might look like this:

    void CMainMDIFrame::OnInitialUpdate()
    {
        // Add some dockers
        DWORD dwStyle = DS_CLIENTEDGE; // The style added to each docker
        int DockWidth = 150;
        AddDockedChild(new CDockFiles, DS_DOCKED_LEFT | dwStyle, DockWidth);
        AddDockedChild(new CDockFiles, DS_DOCKED_RIGHT | dwStyle, DockWidth);

        // Add some MDI children
        AddMDIChild(new CSimpleMDIChild);
        AddMDIChild(new CSimpleMDIChild);
    }

* Windows created by CWnd::Create can now be initially created as maximized or
   minimized by specifying the WS_MAXIMIZE or WS_MINIMIZE styles in PreCreate,
   even though this is not supported by the CreateWindowEx Windows API function.

* Frames now load the save state (maximized or normal) from the registry.

* Added DockMDI sample.
  This sample demonstrates adding Dockers to MDI Frames.

* Dockers now default to fixed size resizing instead of proportional size
   resizing for dock children. The DS_FIXED_RESIZE style has been replaced with
   DS_NO_FIXED_RESIZE.


Version 7.6
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added StatusBar themes.
   StatusBars can fill the background with a color gradient. The two
   colors can be specified by SetStatusBarTheme.

* Switching between views is now supported, using SetView
  The following classes support switching views:
   - Frames
   - MDI Children
   - Dockers
   - DockContainers

* Updated Frames
   - IDW_INDICATOR_CAPS, IDW_INDICATOR_NUM and IDW_INDICATOR_SCRL string
      resources are used to define the status indicators. These string
      resources should be added to the resource script (resource.rc). Refer
      to resource.rc in the frame sample for an example.

* Updated Dockers
   - Dock targets invalidated by DS_NO_DOCKCHILD_XXXX are hidden or grayed.
   - Click and drag tab swaps to swap them for DockContainers and TabbedMDIs.
   - Parent dockers have a minimum size.
   - Added support for DS_FIXED_RESIZE. Normally dock children are resized
      proportionally, but with this style the size of dock children is fixed.
   - Dock containers with a single tab can hide the tab.
   - Improved hinting for container within container docking.

* Added support for vertical ToolBars and ReBars
   - Vertical ToolBars and ReBars can be themed by CFrame. These are
      demonstrated in the ReBar and ToolBar samples.

* Updated the samples
   - Added DateTime sample to demonstrate CDateTime and CMonthCalendar.
   - Added ToolBar sample. It demonstrates customizing ToolBars by dynamically
      adding or removing ToolBar buttons. It also demonstrates an additional
      ToolBar which can be positioned at the top, bottom, left or right of the
      view window.
   - Added ReBar sample. It demonstrates an additional ReBar which contains
      a ToolBar and can be positioned at the top, bottom, left or right of the
      view window.
   - Added StatusBar sample. It demonstrates a colored StatusBar with a
      hyperlink, a progress bar, an icon and an owner drawn part.
   - A window menu has been added to the DockTabbedMDI sample.
   - The Themes sample demonstrates how to save a rebar's band sizes and
      positions in the registry.
   - The Themes sample demonstrates StatusBar themes.
   - The Dock sample demonstrates various dock styles including:
     - Proportional Resize
     - 3D Border
     - Disable Undocking
     - Disable Resizing
     - Disable Dock closing
     - Disable docking on the left or right


Version 7.5
===========
Bug Fixes:
* The drop-down lists for combo boxes are now displayed correctly.
* Fix for ToolBars on Win95

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added CRichEdit. This class provides support for Rich Edit controls
* Updated the approach to using threads
   - CWinThread is used in place of CThread.
   - CWinApp now inherits from CWinThread.
   - GUI threads are now implemented without multiple inheritance. Refer to
     the Threads and DirectX samples for an example of how to create GUI
     threads.
   - CWinThread provides a constructor to facilitate worker threads. This
     constructor allows users to specify the thread's callback function and
     a LPVOID pParams parameter.
   - The thread is now created using the CreateThread member function rather
     than being automatically created in the constructor. This provides more
     control over if and when the thread is created.
* Updated CWinApp
   - CWinApp now inherits from CWinThread. Some member functions were moved
     from CWinApp to CWinThread.
   - Added wrapper functions for loading and setting the cursor, and loading
     icons.
* Updated CFrame
   - A keyboard hook is used to retrieve keyboard indicators (NUM, CAPS, SCRL),
     removing the need for a timer.
   - If the co-ordinates retrieved from registry would place the frame off
     screen, the frame is repositioned.
   - Added GetTitle, SetTitle, GetStatusText and SetStatusText functions.
* Updated CDocker and CTab
   - CTabs and CDockers now support the WS_EX_LAYOUTRTL extended style. This
     style creates a window whose horizontal origin is on the right edge to
     better suite Arabic and Hebrew languages.
* Updated CDialog
   - Added support for OnIdle in modal dialogs. Modeless dialogs already have
     OnIdle support.


Version 7.4
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added CImageList. CImageList manages a collection of images (Image List).
* Added ToolBarDemo Sample.
   - demonstrates ToolBar customization.
   - demonstrates adding and removing ToolBar buttons.
   - demonstrates saving and restoring ToolBar layout.
   - demonstrates changing the ToolBar's image list.
* Updated CWnd:
   - Modified OnCreate. It now provides a LPCREATSTRUCT. Any function overriding
      OnCreate will need to be modified too.
   - Added OnAttach. It is called when a window is attached to a CWnd.
   - Added OnClose. It is called when a window asks to be closed (WM_CLOSE).
   - Added OnDestroy. It is called when a window is destroyed (WM_DESTROY).
   - CreateWindowEx now uses HMENU or UINT instead of CMenu*. This allows
      the menu parameter to specify a menu for a parent window, or a window ID
      for a child window.
* Updated CFrame:
   - Frames now use the IDW_READY resource for the "Ready" string.
   - CFrame no longer requires the number of images in the ToolBar bitmap to
      equal the number of ToolBar buttons. The width of the button bitmap is
      now assumed to be equal to its height or a minimum of 16.
   - The code for ToolBar and MenuBar themes has been moved to CFrame, making it
      easier to customize. Also, the notifications (from WM_NOTIFY) are handled in
      virtual functions, making them easier to override.
   - ToolBars for DockContainers automatically use the Frame's ToolBar theme.
   - We can now specify the index of the image in AddToolbarButton.
* Updated CFile:
   - CFile functions are now virtual.
   - OpenFileDialog and SaveFileDialog allow the dialog's title to be specified.
* Updated CToolBar
   - SetButtonInfo can now be used to change a ToolBar button's image and
      command ID.
   - Functions now use CImageList* instead of HIMAGELIST
   - Added support for ToolBar customization.
   - AddButton now also allows us to specify the image's index.
* Updated CDialog
   - Added GetDefID, GotoDlgCtrl, MapDialogRect, NextDlgCtrl, PrevDlgCtrl
      and SetDefID.
   - The constructor no longer sets the dialog's parent. The parent of the dialog
      (if any) is set when the dialog is created (with DoModal or DoModeless).
* Updated CTab.
   - CTab now provides wrapper functions for all the Tab control macros.


Version 7.3
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Adjusted the frame's appearance
    - Updated the visual appearance of popup menus on systems using Windows Aero. On
      systems with Aero, popup menus are rendered with Windows Visual Styles. Systems
      without Aero continue to use the Win32++ theme for popup menus.
    - Frames now honour the current window theme's menu and status fonts.
    - the frame's appearance changes dynamically to reflect changes to the window theme.
    - minor adjustment to the ReBar theme colors for the "Modern" theme.
* Added the following controls
   - CDateTime
   - CHeader
   - CHotKey
   - CIPAddress
   - CMonthCalendar
   - CTooltip

Version 7.2
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added CString class
   The CString class is intended to provide much of the same functionality
   as the CString class provided with MFC/ATL.
* Added CMenu
   The CMenu class is intended to provide much of the same functionality
   as the CMenu class provided with MFC. The library now standardises on
   using pointers to CMenu, instead of HMENU.
* Added CFile
   This class provides a convenient wrapper for functions dealing with files.
* Added Idle processing.
   The Idle processing is also available for use by users, and is used in much
   the same way as OnIdle processing in MFC.

Version 7.1
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added support for Task Dialogs
* Added the following set of GDI classes: CBitmap, CBrush, CFont, CPalette,
   CPen and CRgn. These work in cooperation with the existing CDC class.
* Added a set of new Text conversion functions based on classes.
   The complete set of functions are:
    A2BSTR      ANSI  to BSTR
    A2OLE       ANSI  to OLE
    A2T         ANSI  to TCHAR
    A2W         ANSI  to WCHAR
    OLE2A       OLE   to ANSI
    OLE2T       OLE   to TCHAR
    OLE2W       OLE   to WCHAR
    T2A         TCHAR to ANSI
    T2BSTR      TCHAR to BSTR
    T2OLE       TCHAR to OLE
    T2W         TCHAR to Wide
    W2A         WCHAR to ANSI
    W2BSTR      WCHAR to BSTR
    W2OLE       WCHAR to OLE
    W2T         WCHAR to TCHAR
   Refer to the help documentation for instructions on using these functions.

Version 7.0
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added CThread class to simplify the task of using threads and creating
   windows in different threads. CThread can be used for both worker threads
   and GUI threads. Refer to the Thread and DirectX samples for examples of
   how to use CThread to create windows in a different thread. The DirectX
   sample also uses a customized message loop for the thread.
* Added the following control wrappers: CAnimation, CComboBox, CComboBoxEx,
   CProgressBar, CScrollBar, CSlider, and CSpinButton.
* Added support for re-sizable dialogs. The CResizer class has been added
   to dialog.h to facilitate dialog resizing. Refer to the forms sample for
   an example of how to put CResizer to use.
* Added IPv6 support to CSocket. The network samples have been updated to
   take advantage of IPv6 support. IP version 6 is supported on Vista
   operating systems and newer.
* Added Shared_Ptr class. Note that a "shared_ptr" will be available for the
   updated C++ standard. It is already available with some modern compilers,
   and also for users of the Boost library. The "Shared_Ptr" class is intended
   as an alternative for those users who would like to use a "shared_ptr", but
   don't have access to one yet. Unlike auto-ptr's, shared_ptr's can be used
   to safely store pointers in vectors and other STL containers.
* Added the GDIPlus sample to demonstrate how to use the GDIPlus library
   provided with modern Windows operating systems (XP and above).
* Win32++ can now be run from inside a DLL. The "DLL" sample demonstrates how to
   put a Win32++ dialog in a dll, and run it from a test program.


Version 6.9
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added a WebBrowser class called CWebBrowser.  This class provides a web
   browser in a window. This class can be used as a view window anywhere
   view windows are used, such as in frames, dockers, MDI Children,
   Tabbed MDIs etc.  It has no dependence on ATL, greatly simplifying the
   approach to adding a browser window to any application.  It can be compiled
   by any of the supported compilers including Dev-C++, MinGW and the Borland
   compilers as well as the compilers from Microsoft.
* Added an ActiveX host class called CAXHost.
* Modified the Browser sample to use the new CWebBrowser class. It also
   demonstrates how to use an event sink to get notification of browser events.
* Added a Tray sample which demonstrates how to create an application
   which can be minimised to the system tray, and restored.


Version 6.8
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Support has been added for the Windows Ribbon Framework available on
   Windows 7 operating systems. The RibbonFrame and RibbonSimple samples
   demonstrates how to implement the ribbon. RibbonFrame reverts back to
   using the traditional Toolbar and Menubar if the operating system doesn't
   support the ribbon framework.
* Helper classes have been added for the standard controls, namely the Button,
   Edit, Listbox, and Static controls.
* Dockers can now be hidden and unhidden. Refer to the Splitter sample for a
   demonstration of this feature.
* Modal dialogs now support pretranslated messages.


Version 6.7
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* A set of tools is now provided in the tools folder. They include a set of
   batch files for compiling the examples and batch files to "clean" them.
* Support has been added for Right to Left languages which include Hebrew and
   Arabic. The CFrame and CDocker classes now honour the WS_EX_LAYOUTRTL
   extended style used by these languages. To take advantage of this feature,
   use PreCreate to set this extended when using CFrame, CMDIFrame, CTab,
   CTabbedMDI, and CDocker.
* OnInitialUpdate is now called after Attach or AttachDlgItem.


Version 6.6
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Enhancements to docking, containers and tabs.
  - By default the dockers are immediately resized while the splitter bar is
     being dragged. To defer resizing until the splitter bar is released, use
     SetDragAutoResize(FALSE).
  - The close and list buttons now indicate when they are hot and pressed.
  - Added SetTabText, SetTabImage and SwapTabs to the CTab class.
  - Minor improvements to the painting of tabs, containers and dockers.
* Enhancements to GDI graphics support.
  - The CDC class has been extended. It now includes wrapper functions for
     the Device Context related functions.
  - Added the CBitmapInfoPtr class. This simplifies the use of the BITMAPINFO
     structure in functions like GetDIBits and SetDIBits.
  - Added GrayScaleBitmap function to gdi.h. It converts a colored bitmap to
     to gray-scale.
* Enhancements to frames
  - When a menu is about to be displayed, OnUpdateMenu is called to provide
     an opportunity to modify the check state of the menu items.
  - The style of the rebarband is now specified in AddToolbarBand. This
     facilities saving and restoring ToolBar settings from the registry (as
     demonstrated in the Themes example.)
  - The Frame's ShowToolbar and ShowStatusbar states are now saved in the
     registry.


Version 6.5
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Precompiled Headers
   Samples now demonstrates the use of Precompiled Headers. More experienced
   users might prefer this approach as it provides for much faster compile times.
* Added CTab class.
   This class is used by CContainer and CTabbedMDI, and can also be used as a
   view window.
* Added TabDemo example.
   Refer to the TabDemo example for a demonstration of how CTab class is
   used as a view window in a frame. TabDialogDemo also uses CTab.
* Added CTabbedMDI class.
   A TabbedMDI can be used as a view window for a Frame or a Dockable. As the
   name suggests, it provides tabs for a MDI window.
* Added TabbedMDI example within docking.
   Refer to the docking TabbedMDI example for a demonstration of how CTabbedMDI
   class is used.


Version 6.4
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Extended support for docking with CDockContainer.
* Added Region support to CDC class.


Version 6.3
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added support for docking.
* Added the Fast GDI demo. This demonstrates the use of the TintBitmap function.
* MDI child windows now require a view window. The use of a view window is
   now the same for Frames, MDI children, and dockables. The MDI demo example
   has been extended to include ListView and TreeView views.
* Added message translation. This allows modeless dialogs and propertysheets
   to process the tab (and other) keys.
* Added a CWnd::Destroy function. This returns a CWnd back to its default
   state ready to be reused.


Version 6.2
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Frame applications now store the window size and position in the registry.
   To enable this, set the m_KeyName member variable in CMainFrame's
   constructor. This member variable can be used to reflect the company name
   and application name, for example:  m_KeyName = _T("SomeCompany\\SomeApp");
* Frame applications now provide a Most Recently Used (MRU) list. This list is
   stored in the registry.
* Extended CWnd
   CWnd now includes functions which wrap many of the Windows API functions
   that affect to windows.


Version 6.1
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* All Win32++ code has been moved to header files.
   This simplifies the use of Win32++. To add Win32++ to a project, simply
   include the appropriate Win32++ header files in your code. There is no
   longer any need to add the Win32++ files to the project, although doing so
   may still prove useful under some circumstances. Depending on the
   compiler/IDE used, adding the Win32++ header files to the project may add
   the various Win32++ classes to the class view.
* Added CListView class.
   This class encapsulates the various messages and macros used by the Win32/64
   API to manage the List-View common control. You can inherit from this class
   when creating your own List-View control in a window, or attaching a
  List-View control from a dialog.
* Added CTreeView class.
   This class encapsulates the various messages and macros used by the
   Win32/64 API to manage the Tree-View common control. You can inherit from
   this class when creating your own Tree-View control in a window, or
   attaching a Tree-View control from a dialog.
* Added CPoint CRect and CSize classes
   The CPoint, CRect and CSize classes can be used anywhere a POINT, RECT
   or SIZE struct is used.
* Added support for x64 applications.
   Win32++ can now be used to build 64 bit applications. The manifest file has
   been modified to support both 32bit and 64bit applications. The new manifest
   should be used for any 64 bit applications that use common controls. Users
   are encouraged to use the modern Win64 API functions like:
   GetWindowLongPtr, SetWindowLongPtr, GetClassLongPtr and SetClassLongPtr.
   Win32++ will convert these back to their Win32 API counterparts if required.
* 32 bit bitmaps are now supported for toolbars (requires XP or Vista)


Version 6.0
===========

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Win32++ now also directly supports the Windows CE operating systems.
   Windows CE is the operating system used on such things as Pocket PCs,
   embedded systems and SmartPhones. The Win32++ examples for Windows CE
   include the project files for eMbedded Visual C++ 4.0, and Visual
   Studio 2005.
* Added Networking support. Win32++ now includes a CSocket class which
   encapsulates much of the Winsock API. This class is capable of monitoring
   network events, such as connection requests from clients, and notification
   that the socket has data ready to be received. Command line and dialog
   examples are provide to demonstrate how the class can be used to create
   TCP/IP (and UDP/IP) servers and clients.
* Added a CDC class. This class simplifies the drawing to device contexts.
   This class can be used anywhere we would normally use a handle to a
   device context (HDC). Its features include:
   - Automates the selection of GDI objects into the device context.
   - Automates the destruction of GDI objects.
   - Automates the deletion or release of the device contexts.
* PreRegisterClass can now be used to set the WNDCLASS parameters before the
   window class is registered. This provides a convenient way to set a window's
   background brush or cursor.

Version 5.6
===========
* Property sheets are now supported. Property sheets can be modal, modeless
  or Wizards.

Version 5.5
===========
* Added Menubar theme support
  - Gradient background for hot buttons (any two colors)
  - Gradient background for pressed buttons (any two colors)
  - Gradient Sidebar for menu items based on pressed button colors.
  - A border color for Menubar buttons and selected menu items


Version 5.4
===========
* Added Rebar themes, including:
  - Gradient background for the rebar control (any two colors)
  - Gradient background for the rebar bands (any two colors)
  - The Menubar can be locked in place.
  - The bands can be kept left.
  - Short bands
  - Bands can have rounded borders
  - Bands with rounded borders can have a flat style
* Added Toolbar themes, including:
  - Gradient background for hot buttons (any two colors)
  - Gradient background for pressed buttons (any two colors)
  - Colored outline for hot and pressed buttons (any color)
* CRebar provides built in support for multiple toolbars with AddToolbarBand

Version 5.3
===========
* Owner drawn drop down menu items with icons.  By default, the
   framework uses the ToolBar's bitmap and resource IDs for displaying
   icons. Override CFrame::SetupToolBar to change this behaviour.
* CreateEx automatically subclasses windows controls such as List-View,
   ToolBar, Richedit etc.


Version 5.2
===========
* Added a separate HINSTANCE for resources. This provides for multilingual
   support, when resources are loaded via a DLL.


Version 5.1
===========
* Attach can be used to subclass existing windows and associate them with a CWnd.
* Dialog controls can be sublcassed and converted to CWnd objects, using
   AttachDlgItem.
* Improvements to CToolbar. The ToolBar uses image lists which support using
  separate bitmaps for normal, hot and disabled buttons. Text can be added
  to ToolBar buttons, and the style can be set.
* Notifications from common controls are reflected back to the CWnd object that
  generated them.
* Messages from old style common controls are reflected back to the CWnd object
  that generated them.


Version 5.0
===========
* Added rebars to the frame window
* Added a menubar to the frame window
* Added MDI frame support


Version 4.0
===========
* Changed the method of associating the Window's handle (HWND) and
   the CWnd pointer.  Previously SetWindowLong was used to store the
   CWin pointer in the windows data area. Now std::map is used to
   associate a CWnd pointer with the HWND (i.e. the window's handle).
* Added the lpParam parameter to both versions of the CWnd::CreateEx
   function.  Users are now free to use lpParam for their own
   purposes. This parameter defaults to NULL for backwards
   compatibility.


Version 3.0
===========
* Added Tracing. To use tracing, ensure that you are in Debug mode,
   i.e. the variable _DEBUG is defined, and use the TRACE("xxxxx")
   function to send trace messages.
* Enhanced the error reporting in the event of an exception. The
   GetLastError information is now decoded and displayed if it
   provides any additional information.
* Added support for multi-threaded applications.


Version 2.0
===========
* The code is now Unicode compliant.
* Added CWinApp class to start Win32++.
* Added CDialog class to support modal and modeless dialogs as well
   as indirect dialogs (dialogs created from a dialog template in
   memory).
* Added the Create function to simplify window creation.


Version 1.0
===========
Initial Release
