Version 10.1
============
This version updates the library and samples to make better use of the new
features in C++14. Some deprecated classes and functions have been removed.
Dialogs with RichEdit controls might need to be updated to be compatible
with this version.
 

Incompatibilities with previous versions
----------------------------------------
* Support for RichEdit controls in dialogs have changed. Dialogs which have a
  RichEdit control now need to specify "RichEdit50W" as the control's class
  name in the dialog's resource script (resource.rc) if they depend on the
  RichEdit dll loaded by CRichEdit.

  The relevant entry for the richedit control might look something like this:
  CONTROL     "",IDC_RICHEDIT1,"RichEdit50W" ,ES_MULTILINE | ES_WANTRETURN |
              ES_AUTOHSCROLL | WS_BORDER | WS_TABSTOP, 120, 142, 84, 35

  The dialog won't be created if an incorrect class name is specified for
  the richedit control. The "RichEdit50W" class name supports both ANSI
  and UNICODE builds.


New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Updated CRichEdit.
  The CRichEdit class has been updated and now only loads the latest version
  of the rich edit control (Msftedit.dll). The class name of the RichEdit
  control loaded by CRichEdit is "RichEdit50W".

* Updated the DLL sample.
   The DLL sample now demonstrates how to create modeless dialogs in 
   separate threads. The thread stops running when the dialog is closed.

* The Win32xx::Shared_Ptr class has been removed.
   The deprecated Win32xx::Shared_Ptr class has been removed from Win32++.
   Use either std::unique_ptr or std::shared_ptr instead of
   Win32xx::Shared_Ptr.

* Updated CString and CStringT.
   Added move constructors and move assignments to CString and CStringT.

* Updated CPrintDialog.
   CPrintDialog now displays the classic print dialog by default. To display
   the modern print dialog available on Windows 10 and 11, remove the 
   PD_ENABLEPRINTHOOK flag. This can be done as follows:
   CPrintDialog PrintDialog(0);


Changes in detail
-----------------
 - Added CString::CString(CString&& str)             CString move constructor
 - Added CString::operator=(CString&& str)           CString move assignment
 - Added CStringT::CStringT(CStringT&& str)          CStringT move constructor
 - Added CStringT::operator=(CStringT&& str)         CStringT move assignment

Removed the following deprecated classes and functions: 
 - Shared_Ptr                  class    - use unique_ptr or shared_ptr instead.
 - CFrameT::IsRebarSupported   function - not required, always TRUE.
 - CSocket::StartAsync         function - use CSocket::StartEvents instead.
 - CToolBar::AddBitmap         function - use CToolBar::SetImageList instead.
 - CToolBar::AddReplaceBitmap  function - use CToolBar::SetImageList instead.
 - CToolBar::ReplaceBitmap     function - use CToolBar::SetImageList instead.
 - ::GetSizeofMenuItemInfo     function - use sizeof(MENUITEMINFO) instead.
 - ::GetComCtlVersion          function - not required for Windows XP and later.
 

Version 10.0
============
This version updates the library to utilize features available in C++11 and
C++14. Win32++ now uses the unique_ptr and shared_ptr smart pointers. These
smart pointers are used in place of Shared_Ptr when adding new instances of
CTab, CMDIChild, CPropertySheet and CDocker.

There is now no requirement to use any raw pointers when allocating memory in
code that uses the Win32++ library. Users of Win32++ are now free to avoid 
the use of both new and delete, and instead wrap all memory allocations in
smart pointers. This helps to avoid memory leaks and improve exception safety
in code that uses Win32++.

The C++ compilers that Win32++ supports have changed. Older compilers that
don't support C++14 are no longer supported.

Win32++ version 10.0 only supports the Windows XP and later operating systems. 
Win32++ version 9.6.1 is the latest version to support the operating systems
older than Windows XP. Win32++ version 9.6.1 supports Win95 through to
Windows 11.


Incompatibilities with previous versions
----------------------------------------
The following functions now return a unique_ptr instead of a raw pointer:
* CDocker::NewDockFromID
* CTabbedMDI::NewMDIChildFromID

Code that overrides of these function need to return a unique_ptr as well.
For example:

  DockPtr CMainFrame::NewDockerFromID(int /*id*/)
  {
      DockPtr docker;
      switch(id)
      {
      case ID_CLASSES:
          docker = std::make_unique<CDockClasses>();
          break;
      case ID_FILES:
          docker = std::make_unique<CDockFiles>();
          break;
      default:
          TRACE("Unknown Dock ID\n");
          break;
      }
      return docker;
  }


New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
Users can now add new instances of the following classes as smart pointers instead
of raw pointers for CDocker, CMDIChild, CPropertySheet and CTab.

Other changes include:
 * Updated CDocker. Each new CDocker object is stored as a unique_ptr.
 * Updated CMDIFrame. Each new CMDIChild is stored as a unique_ptr.
 * Updated CMDITab. Each new CMDITab object stored as a unique_ptr.
 * Updated CPropertySheet. Each new CPropertyPage object is stored as a unique_ptr.
 * Updated CTab. Each new CTab object is stored as a unique_ptr.
 * Updated CDC. CDC now uses a shared_ptr for its reference counting.
 * Updated CGDIObject. CGDIObject now uses a shared_ptr for its reference counting.
 * Updated CMenu. CMenu now uses a shared_ptr for its reference counting.
 * Updated CImageList. CImageList now uses a shared_ptr for its reference counting.

* The values for WINVER and related macros are now set to values suitable for 
  Windows 10 and Windows 11 by Win32++. Specifying different values for these macros
  before including wincore.h is no longer supported. Win32++ version 10 supports
  all operating systems Windows XP and later irrespective of the values of these
  version macros.

Version 9.4
===========
This version adds support for the Microsoft Edge browser.
The EdgeBrower and EdgeBrowserEx samples have been added. These samples
demonstrate how to use the Microsoft Edge WebView2 control in a Win32++
application.

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added the EdgeBrowser sample. This sample uses the Microsoft Edge
  WebView2 control to render the Microsoft Edge browser in a window. It
  demonstrates a simple way to render a Microsoft Edge browser in a view
  window.

* Added the EdgeBrowserEx sample. This sample uses the Microsoft Edge WebView2
  control to display tabs and render the Microsoft Edge browser within those
  tabs. This sample also demonstrates features such as managing favourites
  and browser history.

* Updated CDC. CDC::SelectObject now keeps the selected object in scope. There
  is no longer any need to select the old object back into the device context
  when SelectObject is used.


Version 9.3
===========
This version improves the support for high resolution monitors by automatically
adjusting the size of the frame's toolbar bitmaps and menu icons appropriately.
A number of functions have been added to make supporting high resolution
monitors easier (see below). 

This version also provides support for per-monitor(v2) DPI awareness.
Per-monitor DPI awareness allows applications to maintain their visual quality
when they are moved between monitors with different Dots Per Inch (DPI)
settings.

The new FrameEx sample demonstrates the use of PNG resources instead of bitmap
resources for the toolbar and menu images. 

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* The toolbar bitmaps are automatically scaled up to a size appropriate for
  the frame window's DPI. Bitmaps that are appropriate for lower resolution
  monitors are be scaled up for use on higher resolution monitors without
  a noticeable loss of visual quality.

* The menu icon bitmaps are automatically scaled up to fit the menu item.
  Note that menu icon bitmaps are not scaled down to fit the menu item, as 
  that would result in poor image quality. If the menu item images specified
  in the frame's SetupMenuItemIcons are too big to fit in the menu item,
  the menu icons are not displayed.

* Frames support per monitor DPI awareness by resizing themselves to the 
  size recommended by the WM_DPICHANGED message in the OnDpiChanged function.
  They also automatically adjust the toolbar images, menu icons, and statusbar
  fonts when the frame window is moved between monitors with different DPI
  settings.  

* Dockers and docking frames call OnDpiChanged and OnDpiChangedBeforeParent
  in response to WM_DPICHANGED and WM_DPICHANGED_BEFOREARENT to rearrange
  dockers after a DPI change occurs. View windows should handle the
  WM_DPICHANGEDBEFOREPARENT message if they need to account for DPI 
  changes.  
  
* CResizer supports per monitor DPI awareness by repositioning the child
  windows when the WM_DPICHANGED or WM_DPICHANGED_BEFOREPARENT message is
  handled.

* Added the FrameEx sample.
  The FrameEx sample uses PNG images instead of bitmaps for the toolbar 
  and menu item images. As PNG images scale better than bitmaps, this approach
  is better for applications supporting Per Monitor DPI and high resolution
  monitors.

About high resolution monitor support
-------------------------------------
Modern monitors can now use scaling factors of 400% or more. Applications that
look good with scaling factors of 100% or 150% may not look good at higher
scaling factors. It will often be necessary to adjust the image-list for
list-view and tree-view controls and adjust the fonts used by other windows
to cater for larger scaling factors.

Win32++ provides the following functions for high resolution monitor support.
::GetWindowDpi
CWnd::DpiScaleFont
CWnd::DpiScaleInt
CWnd::DpiScaleLogFont
CWnd::DpiScaleRect
CWnd::DpiScaleUpBitmap

The GetWindowDpi function retrieves the window's current DPI. We can also
call GetWindowDpi(HWND_DESKTOP) to retrieve the system DPI, and the desktop's
DPI when per monitor dpi awareness is enabled.

The various DpiScaleXXX functions take values that are appropriate for a 
a scaling factor of 100% and scale them up to the appropriate values for
the current window's Dots Per Inch (DPI).

About per monitor dpi aware v2
------------------------------
Per monitor dpi aware v2 is a feature that allows applications to maintain
their visual quality when moved between monitors with different DPI settings.
Applications may appear blurry when moved between monitors with different DPI
settings unless per monitor dpi aware v2 is enabled. Per monitor dpi aware v2
is supported on later versions of Windows 10 and Windows 11.

To add per-monitor dpi aware v2 to your application, use a manifest that
includes the per monitor dpi aware v2 entry, such as "PerMonitorV2.manifest"
provided in many of the samples. The manifest should be specified in the
application's resource script, often called "resource.rc". You may also need
to handle the WM_DPICHANGED_BEFOREPARENT message in view windows if they 
require special DPI handling.

If per monitor dpi aware v2 is enabled, a WM_DPICHANGED message is sent to the
top level windows after the DPI change occurs. That usually occurs when the 
window is moved between monitors, but can also occur as a result of a settings
change. A WM_DPICHANGED_BEFOREPARENT to all of the top level window's child and
descendant windows before the WM_DPICHANGED message is sent. A 
WM_DPICHANGED_AFTERPARENT message is is sent to all of the top level window's
child and descendant windows After the WM_DPICHANGED is sent.

The following messages are sent when the application's manifest specifies per
monitor dpi aware V2:

WM_GETDPISCALEDSIZE
Sent to the top level window before the DPI change occurs. The WPARAM
contains the new DPI.

WM_DPICHANGED
Sent to top level windows after a DPI change occurs. The LPARAM contains a 
pointer to rect that provides the suggested new size of the window. 

WM_DPICHANGED_BEFOREPARENT
Sent before the DPI change to all child windows and descendants of the top
level window that is undergoing a DPI change.

WM_DPICHANGED_AFTERPARENT
Sent after the DPI change to all child windows and descendants of the top
level window that is undergoing a DPI change.

WM_SETTINGCHANGE
Sent when the user manually changes the display settings.


Version 9.2
===========
This version provides support for dark mode and provides a sample
that demonstrates how to implement dark mode for a frame application.

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Added support for colored text in the status bar.
  CFrame now uses owner draw to render the status bar, allowing different
  colored text to be displayed. The StatusBarTheme struct has been extended
  to allow the status bar text color to be specified. The Themes sample 
  demonstrates the use of different colored text in the status bar.

* Added support for dark mode.
  CFrame now provides support for dark mode by providing the option to use a
  dark menu. This can be used to develop an application with an appropriate
  visual style for dark mode when combined with a black Win32++ theme. Refer
  to the black theme in the Themes sample, and also the DarkMode sample.

* Added the DarkModeFrame sample.
  This samples demonstrates how to make a Win32++ application dark mode aware.
  It uses the Windows App API which is an optional feature that can be 
  installed with Visual Studio Community 2022. This sample detects when the
  Windows theme is using dark mode, and adjusts the frame's theme accordingly.
  The sample also uses a dialog that supports dark mode to display the 
  information about the application. 
  This samples requires Windows 10 or later.


Version 9.1
===========
This version improves support for high resolution monitors by accepting a
range of icon sizes used for menus, tab controls and dock containers.

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Updated the images for menus used by CFrame and CDockFrame.
  - Win32++ now supports a range of image sizes displayed in the popup menu for
    CFrame and CDockFrame. The GetMenuIconHeight function returns the
    appropriate height of these images in pixels (16, 24, 32 etc.). The 
    framework will automatically scale the toolbar images down to a size
    suitable for the popup menu for the toolbar bitmap with a resource ID of
    IDW_MAIN. Alternatively you can provide icons with multiple image sizes as
    demonstrated in the samples.

* Updated the ListView sample.
  - An edit control has been added to provide support the in-place editing of
    the List-View's and subitems. A List-View control doesn't have built-in
    support for the editing of subitems.
  - Support for sorting by column has been added. To sort a column in ascending
    or descending order, click on the column in the list-view's header.


Version 9.0
===========
This version provides a major update to the framework. Changes include updates to CString and thread support.
The following samples have been added:
 * DialogTemplate sample
 * PrintDialogEx sample
 * Titlebar sample
 * TitlebarFrame sample

New Features and Enhancements
-----------------------------
* Updated thread support. Thread classes now use the CThreadT class template.
  Threads that support windows continue to use CWinThread. Worker threads now
  use CWorkThread. 
  CWinThread inherits from CThreadT<CMessagePump>.
  CWorkThread inherits from CThreadT<CObject>.

* The values for WINVER and related macros now default to values suitable for 
  Windows 10 and Windows 11. Different values can be specified before including
  wincore.h if required. These values can be specified in stdafx.h by including
  targetver.h as shown in the samples. Visual Studio 6 will require WINVER to
  be set to values appropriate for Win95 or Win98.

* Updated CDialog
  Added a default constructor. Use either the SetDialogTemplate, 
  SetDialogResource or SetDialogFromID functions to specify the dialog if the
  default constructor is used.

* Updated the MenuTheme struct.
  A clrText member has been added to the MenuTheme struct to define the color of
  menubar text. This is now used to set the menubar text color to white for the
  BLACK theme in the themes sample.

* Added the DialogTemplate sample.
  This sample demonstrates how to search for the resources embedded in a
  windows executable or dll file. The user can select a dialog from the list
  of dialogs found in the file. The dialog template of the selected dialog is
  displayed in a rich edit view as an unsigned char array in a manner that can
  be saved to a header file. The program then creates the dialog from the 
  displayed dialog template and displays it.

* Added the PrintDialogEx sample.
  This sample upgrades the Notepad sample. Where the Notepad sample used
  CPrintDialog to display the print dialog, this sample uses CPrintDialogEx
  to display the print dialog. This sample supports printing individual
  pages, as well as multiple page ranges. It also supports printing multiple
  copies, with or without collating. A footer displaying the page number is
  added to the bottom of the printed page.

* Added the Titlebar sample.
  This sample demonstrates how to customize the title bar of a window. It sets
  the title bar's color and draws the minimize, maximize and close buttons.
  The sample uses CMenuBar to display a menu in the title bar.

* Added the TitlebarFrame sample.
  This sample demonstrates how to use a customized title bar with a frame.
  It demonstrates the frame in two modes: mini-frame and full-frame.
