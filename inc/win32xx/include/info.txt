CodeBlocks is an IDE. The project files are configured for the following
compilers:
* Borland Compiler Version 5.5
* MinGW GNU compiler
* Visual C++ Toolkit 2003

Dev-C++ is an IDE that supports the MinGW GNU compiler

Supported Operating Systems
===========================
The programs compiled with Win32++ can run on the following operating systems:
* Win95 (all versions, with or without Internet Explorer 4 installed)
* Win98 (both versions)
* WinME
* Windows NT 4
* Windows 2000
* Windows XP x32
* Windows XP x64
* Windows Vista x32
* Windows Vista x64
* Windows 7 x32
* Windows 7 x64
* Windows 8 x32
* Windows 8 x64
* Windows 8.1 x32
* Windows 8.1 x64
* Windows 10 x32
* Windows 10 x64
* Windows 11
* Windows Server 2003 x32
* Windows Server 2003 x64
* Windows Server 2008 x32
* Windows Server 2008 x64
* Windows Server 2012
* Windows Server 2016
* Windows Server 2019
* Windows Server 2022

Win32++ is Unicode compliant and can therefore be used to develop Unicode
applications. Users are advised that older operating systems (namely Win95,
Win98 and WinME) will require code to be compiled as ANSI, as they
don't support Unicode applications. 

Code compiled with the more modern versions of visual studio may not run
older operating systems. 64bit code only runs on 64bit operating systems.
32bit code runs on both 32bit and 64bit operating systems.

Directory Structure
===================
When extracting the files from the zip archive, be sure to preserve the
directory structure. The directory structure will look like this:

.\help
.\include
.\output
.\samples
.\tools
.\tutorials

The files that form the Win32++ library are contained in the include
folder.
