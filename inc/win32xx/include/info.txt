* MinGW GNU compiler
* Visual C++ Toolkit 2003

Dev-C++ is an IDE which supports the MinGW GNU compiler

Supported Operating Systems
===========================
The programs compiled with Win32++ can run on the following operating systems:
* Win95 (all versions, with or without Internet Explorer 4 installed)
* Win98 (both versions)
* WinME
* Windows NT 4
* Windows 2000
* Windows XP
* Windows XP x64
* Windows Vista
* Windows Vista x64
* Windows 7
* Windows 7 x64
* Windows 8
* Windows 8 x 64
* Windows 8.1
* Windows 8.1 x 64
* Windows 10
* Windows 10 x 64
* Windows 11 x 64
* Windows Server 2003
* Windows Server 2003 x64
* Windows Server 2008
* Windows Server 2008 x64
* Windows Server 2012
* Windows Server 2016
* Windows Server 2019
* Windows Server 2022

Note: Programs compiled with Visual Studio 2008 and Visual Studio 2008
Express will not run on Win32 operating systems earlier than Windows 2000.

Win32++ is Unicode compliant and can therefore be used to develop Unicode
applications. Users are advised that older operating systems (namely Win95,
Win98 and WinME) will require code to be compiled as ANSI, as they
don't support Unicode applications.

Win32++ supports 64bit compilers, and can be used to develop 64bit code.

Directory Structure
===================
When extracting the files from the zip archive, be sure to preserve the
directory structure. The directory structure will typically look like this:

.\help
.\include
.\output
.\samples
.\tools
.\tutorials
.\WCE samples

The files which form the Win32++ library are contained in the include
folder.
